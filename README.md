# Loan Default Risk Analysis 📊

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of loan application data to identify patterns and risk factors leading to loan defaults. By understanding borrower demographics, income levels, credit history, and loan attributes, financial institutions can **improve risk assessment strategies** and **reduce default rates**.

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Analyze loan application data to detect **trends in default behavior**.  
- Identify key risk factors such as **income, credit amount, age, and contract type**.  
- Visualize correlations between loan attributes and default probability.  
- Provide insights to **optimize lending strategies** and mitigate financial risk.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset consists of loan application records, containing **borrower demographics, income, credit history, loan details, and default status**.  
- Data cleaning and transformation were performed before analysis.
- 
## 📊 Key Analysis Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.  
2. **EDA & Feature Analysis:** Identifying high-risk borrower segments.  
3. **Data Visualization:** Generating heatmaps, box plots, and correlation matrices.  
4. **Risk Assessment & Insights:** Providing recommendations for financial institutions.  

## 📌 Key Findings  
- **High loan amounts relative to income increase the risk of default.**  
- **Younger borrowers have a higher default rate compared to older applicants.**  
- **Certain contract types and property ownership status affect loan repayment likelihood.**  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  
- The code is written in the jupyter notebook 
- So just download code file(loan_default_analysis.ipynb) and datasets
- Then execute the notebook file
